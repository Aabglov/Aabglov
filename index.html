					I'm Kegan.

					Welcome to my website.  Here you can see some of my projects, learn about more about me and get excited about the cool things I can build for you.

          This a demo I've been working on to improve GPS tracking.  The dots above move about the area randomly while a neural network learns how to predict their next positions from their speed and direction.  The squares represent where the network believes the dots to be based on the last location, direction and speed.  To represent more realistic data there's also 20% random noise in both direction and speed.

				<p class="explain">
					I built my own machine learning module called Vudu (Vertically Unified Deep-Learning Utility) which you can check out here: <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Aabglov/Vudu">https://github.com/Aabglov/Vudu</a>.  I was never satisfied with libraries like Keras and Lasagne, but I really loved the flexibility and power of Theano.  Vudu is sort of my answer to harnessing the power of Theano without removing fine-grain control.

				<p class="explain">
					I love building websites.  Here's one I built for a local game shop: <a class="link" href="http://www.retrofixgames.com/missoula">http://www.retrofixgames.com/missoula</a>.  There's a lot I like about this one, but my favorite part is the swipe navigation in mobile view (which I also put in this website).

				<p class="explain cage">
					I'm not all business though.  My friends and I LOVE Nicolas Cage.  We're watching his movies.  All of them.  In chronological order of release.  This week we're watching: <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094/">Face/Off</a>

      <div class="title">A few bits about me</div>
				<p class="explain">
					I believe anything worth doing is worth doing well, every second spent learning is a second well spent and that presentation is everything.
				</p>
	      <p class="explain">
	        I love machine learning.  I have seen beautiful mathematics from the elegantly simple to the ingeniously complex.  I have gained the ability to gather valuable insight from seemingly nothing.  I have felt the parental-like pride of watching something you created succeed.  Still the greatest thing I learned is that mistakes are part of learning and of life.
				</p>
				<p class="explain">
					I believe General Artifical Intelligence will be the greatest invention of my lifetime and when the first one is created I want to be there to say hello.
