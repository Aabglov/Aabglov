				<p class="explain">
					I'm Kegan.
				</p>
				<p class="explain">
					This is my website.  It's just a little about me, my projects and my favorite obsession: machine learning.

          This a demo I've been working on to improve GPS tracking on mobile devices.  The dots above move about the area randomly while a neural network learns how to predict their next positions from their speed and direction.  The squares represent where the network believes the dots to be based on the last location, direction and speed.  To represent more realistic data there's also 20% random noise in both direction and speed.
        </p>
				<p class="explain">
          I think this same technology could be applied to mobile sensors such as the accelerometer to reduce the reliance of location-tracking applications on GPS.  This would result in improved battery life while using the apps and the ability to use apps in areas of weak GPS signal.

					I'm working with a local government agency to improve the way they collect data on trees.  I'm creating a Recurrent Neural Network that will learn to predict the height of trees based on the heights of other trees in the immediate area.

          I've played around with a lot of different Machine Learning libraries, but by far my favorite is Theano for Python.  I love the control, the power and the flexibility.  However that same flexibility and power can lead to code that's difficult to understand and debug.  I've seen add-on modules like Lasagne which help standardize things, but at the cost of control.	So I've started my own which you can check out here: <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Aabglov/TheanoSeq2Seq">https://github.com/Aabglov/TheanoSeq2Seq</a>.

					<p class="explain">
					It began as just a sequence-to-sequence program, but has balooned into my personal Machine Learning library.  I'm currently working on automating the initialization of multiple layers and debugging an LSTM that's learning to rap.

      <div class="title">Web Development</div>
        <p class="explain">
          As an exercise in responsive web development I built the website for a local game shop: <a class="link" href="http://missoula.retrofixgaming.com/">http://missoula.retrofixgaming.com/</a>.  I learned a lot from that project, but my favorite trick was the swipe navigation in mobile view (which I also put in this website).
        </p>
				<p class="explain">
					This project was more about pushing my boundaries as a developer and exposing myself to new technologies than machine learning.  I really enjoyed it and the experience eventually allowed me to make my own website.
				</p>
				<p class="explain">
					I'm currently using this template I've developed to rebuild the website for a local pizza joint.  This one is still in early development, but you can compare progress so far.  Before: <a class="link" href="http://www.bigapizza.com/">http://www.bigapizza.com</a>.  After: <a class="link" href="http://aabglov.github.io/Biga-Pizza/">http://aabglov.github.io/Biga-Pizza/</a>

    <div id='why' class="large-10 columns end">
      <div class="title">A few bits about me</div>
				<p class="explain">
					I believe anything worth doing is worth doing well, every second spent learning is a second well spent and that presentation is everything.
				</p>
	      <p class="explain">
	        I love machine learning.  I have seen beautiful mathematics from the elegantly simple to the ingeniously complex.  I have gained the ability to gather valuable insight from seemingly nothing.  I have felt the parental-like pride of watching something you created succeed.  Still the greatest thing I learned is that mistakes are part of learning and of life.
				</p>
				<p class="explain">
					I believe General Artifical Intelligence will be the greatest invention of my lifetime and when the first one is created I want to be there to say hello.
