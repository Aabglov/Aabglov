          <!-- PRESENTATION IS EVERYTHING -->
  <div id='cv' class="row">

  		<div class="title">Who</div>
        <p class="explain">
          I'm Kegan.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          This is my webpage.  It's just a little about me, my career and my favorite obsession: machine learning.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I believe anything worth doing is worth doing well, every second spent learning is a second well spent and that presentation is everything.

  	</div>

    <div id='experience' class="large-10 columns">
      <div class="title">What</div>
				<p class="explain">
					I'm the Senior Data Scientist at <a class="link" href="http://www.yourdatasmarter.com">GCS</a>.
				</p>
        <p class="explain">
          I do a little bit of everything at my current job.  In addition to the normal responsibilities of a Software Engineer I'm also in charge of all client algorithms from simple geometric formulas to Neural Networks.  This includes verification, implementation, integration, refactoring, definition/documentation and optimization.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I wear a lot of hats.  I'm a team member, a project leader and an independent contractor.  I've learned how to manage customer expectations, time, resources and stress.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I have worked on several machine learning projects for various clients from local businesses to government agencies.  I've been responsible for design, documentation, server implementation, mobile applications, optimizations and occassionally a full stack solution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id='tools' class="large-10 columns">
      <div class="title">How</div>
        <p class="explain">
          I use a lot of different tools and skills in my day-to-day. The first things I use everyday are an 8oz single-shot Mocha and a Mac.  I'll happily program on a Linux box as well.  Or a tablet connected to an AWS instance.  I've even programmed on my phone once.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          My IDE of choice is different depending on the language.  IDLE is my favorite for Python, but command-line/nano is a close second.  For web development I love Atom (I'm using Atom right now to write this).  When all else fails Notepad++ is extremely versatile.  I'll also use Visual Studio if I have no other choice.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          My language of choice for Machine Learning is Python.  Specifically I use a numerical computation module called Theano.  I've used scikit-learn, PyBrain, Pylearn2, but I find none of them compare.  Tensorflow is very powerful as well, but I prefer the fine-grianed control of Theano.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          Finally I rely heavily on my background in mathematics to build and train models.  I refused to create a Neural Network in any language until I had derived the formula for Backpropagation by hand.  Ultimately a thorough understanding of math and code is required to be successful when creating complex models.

    <div id='now' class="large-10 columns end">
      <div class="title">When</div>
        <p class="explain">
          Right now I'm working on a machine learning application for a local government agency and wrangling with a <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Aabglov/TheanoSeq2Seq">LSTM-RNN</a> to reverse words.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I'm trying to run a 7:30 mile.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I'm creating a Magic: The Gathering deck to play at a local game shop <a class="link" href="http://missoula.retrofixgaming.com/">whose website I built.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I'm playtesting Pokemon Go, but I don't think I'm supposed to talk about that...

    <div id='why' class="large-10 columns end">
      <div class="title">Why</div>
	      <p class="explain">
	        I love machine learning.  I have seen some truly beautiful mathematics, gained the ability to gather insight from seemingly nothing, felt the parental pride of seeing something you created succeed and learned an extremely important lesson: mistakes are part of learning and of life.
				</p>
				<p class="explain">
					I believe General Artifical Intelligence will be the greatest invention of my lifetime and when the first one is created I want to be there to say hello.
