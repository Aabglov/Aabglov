        <p class="explain">
          I am Kegan Rabil: fiercely dedicated, solution oriented and constantly searching for new challenges and learning opportunities. I am deeply fascinated by the fields of Mathematics, Big Data and Machine Learning.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          If a problem interests me I will work it until I figure it out or die. I consider every second learning to be a second well spent. When given the chance I will build everything myself before relying on a module or widget. I don't like using something until I could explain it to a 6 year old.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I believe anything worth doing is worth doing well, good design isn't something only UI experts should worry about and presentation is everything.</div>

          I do a little bit of everything at my current job.  In addition to the normal responsibilities of a Software Engineer I'm also in charge of all client algorithms from simple geometric formulas to Neural Networks.  This includes verification, implementation, integration, refactoring, definition/documentations and optimization.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I have work with clients from local businesses to government agencies. I have worked as a member of a team, a project leader and an independent contractor.  I have learned how to manage customer expectations, time and resources in high-stakes contracts.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          I have worked on several Machine Learning and Big Data projects for various clients.  I have been responsible for delivering full-stack solutions including design, documentation, server implementation, client-side integration and real-time optimization.

    <div id='tools' class="large-10 columns">
      <div class="title rainbow">How</div>
      <div class="rainbow">
        <p class="explain">
          I use a lot of different tools and skills in my day-to-day. The first things I use everyday are an 8oz single-shot Mocha and a Mac.  I'll happily program on a Linux box as well.  Or a tablet connected to an AWS instance.  I've even programmed on my phone once.  Basically anything other than a Windows machine.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          My IDE of choice is different depending on the language(s) I'm using.  IDLE (despite its flaws) is my favorite for Python, but command-line/nano is a close second.  For web development I love Atom (I'm using Atom right now to write this).  When all else fails Notepad++ is extremely versatile.  I'll also use Visual Studio if threatened.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          My language of choice for Machine Learning is Python.  Specifically I use a numerical computation module called Theano.  I've used scikit-learn, PyBrain, Pylearn2, but I find none of them compare.  Tensorflow is very powerful as well, but I prefer the fine-grianed control of Theano.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          Finally I rely heavily on my background in mathematics to build and train models.  I use it to approach machine learning algorithms in new ways and think about them beyond pure code.  I refused to create a Neural Network in any language until I had derived the formula for Backpropagation by hand.  Ultimately I believe a thorough understanding of math and code is required to be successful when creating complex models.

      <p class="explain rainbow">
        I love machine learning.  I have learned some truly beautiful mathematics, the ability to gain insight from nothing, the unparalleled joy of seeing something you create succeed and the most important lesson of all: failure is a part of learning. I believe General Artifical Intelligence will be the single greatest invention of my lifetime and when the first one is created I want to be there to say hello.
