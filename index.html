          This is my webpage.  It's just a little about me, my career and my favorite obsession: machine learning.

          I believe anything worth doing is worth doing well, every second spent learning is a second well spent and that presentation is everything.

          I do a little bit of everything at my current job.  In addition to the normal responsibilities of a Software Engineer I'm also in charge of all client algorithms from simple geometric formulas to Neural Networks.  This includes verification, implementation, integration, refactoring, definition/documentation and optimization.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
          When it comes to my tools I like a 8oz single-shot mocha from the local coffee shop, a Mac computer, IDLE or Notepad++ for development, Python and Theano for machine learning and a constant connection to Spotify.  Also preferably a chair to sit in.

          Here's a demo I've been working on to improve GPS tracking on mobile devices.  The dots above move about the area randomly while a neural network learns how to predict their next positions from their speed and direction.  The squares represent where the network believes the dots to be based on the last location, direction and speed.  To represent more realistic data there's also 20% random noise in both direction and speed.
        </p>
				<p class="explain">
          I think this same technology could be applied to mobile sensors such as the accelerometer to reduce the reliance of location-tracking applications on GPS.  This would result in improved battery life while using the apps and the ability to use apps in areas of weak GPS signal.

	      <p class="explain">
	        I love machine learning.  I have seen some truly beautiful mathematics, gained the ability to gather insight from seemingly nothing, felt the parental pride of seeing something you created succeed and learned an extremely important lesson: mistakes are part of learning and of life.
